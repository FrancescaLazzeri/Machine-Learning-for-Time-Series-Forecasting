# Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python

To configure your environment you will need Anaconda, the Python Distribution.

The instructions for installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Once Anaconda is installed you should have `conda` executable in your environment path.

Anaconda provides a concept called environments which allow us to have different dependencies based on what we're working on. The documentation is available [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

We would like to use different conda environment for running jobs on our machines, but when we submit jobs to Azure Machine Learning we will use a different environment. To provide easy access to these environments in jupyter notebooks or jupyter lab we can use `nb_conda` into Anaconda's base environment.

```{bash}
conda install -n base nb_conda
```
